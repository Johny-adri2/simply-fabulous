# About this modpack
## Quick description
This modpack introduces general and advanced optimizations, as well as several quality-of-life mods.
## Reasons why I created this
The difference from other optimization modpacks is more optimization and quality-of-life mods that would be good for general-purpose.
## Reasons why you should use this modpack
1. Both popular and underrated optimization mods to squeeze out the bloat that slows Minecraft down
2. Visual fixes that clean up the looks of the game
3. Quality-of-life stuff like realistic audio, mini map and world map, schematic holograms, etc.
# Building
I use Packwiz, and I use ```Get-Content modlist.txt | ForEach-Object { packwiz modrinth add $_ }``` in PowerShell to import all the mods
